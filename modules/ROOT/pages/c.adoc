[#neo4j-Cdriver]
== Neo4j C Driver

Despite several attempts, Neo4j's HTTP was not well supported in the C community.
This changed with the advent of the binary protocol in Neo4j 3.0.
Chris Leishman wrote a very comprehensive and full featured c-client library for the binary protocol.

[#libneo4j]
== libneo4j-client

Libneo4j-client is a full featured c-library for interacting with Neo4j's binary protocol.
It supports all wire commands, as well as the security features like auth and TLS.

A very performant shell client is provided together with the library.

[NOTE]
This library is not only meant to be used from C/pass:[C++] programs directly, but also as convenient, low-level integration library for other languages like PHP, Ruby and Python.
